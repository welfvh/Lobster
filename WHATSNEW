# What's New in Lobster

Each entry describes what changed for you as a user — not implementation details.

## February 2026

### Browse past conversations
You can now scroll back through your message history with Lobster — both what you
sent and what Lobster replied. Useful for finding links, instructions, or anything
you discussed earlier.

### Lobster can read web pages
Send Lobster any URL and it will fetch and read the page, even JavaScript-heavy
sites like Twitter/X. Great for "summarize this article" or "what does this tweet say?"

### Messages look better
Lobster now renders bold, italic, and formatted text in Telegram instead of showing
raw asterisks and underscores.

### Large files get a clear warning
If you send a file over 20MB (Telegram's limit), you'll get an immediate warning
instead of a silent failure. Use LobsterDrop for larger files.

### LobsterDrop — sync files with your phone or laptop
Drop files into a folder on your Mac (or phone) and they appear on Lobster's server
instantly via Syncthing. No size limits. The upgrade script can set this up for you.

### Welcome guide for new users
First-time users get a quick overview of everything Lobster can do. Existing users
can see it anytime with the /onboarding command.

### Better error messages
When something goes wrong, Lobster now logs exactly what happened with full context,
making problems easier to diagnose and fix.
