# .security-allowlist
# Lines in this file are used to skip false positives in the pre-push security scan.
# Add partial strings that appear in flagged lines to allowlist them.
# Comments (lines starting with #) and blank lines are ignored.
#
# Examples:
#   test_api_key = "sk-test-not-real"
#   noreply@github.com
#   192.168.1.1
#
# Be specific - broad patterns may mask real issues.

# install.sh: variable assignment from user input, not a hardcoded secret
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$API_KEY"

# config.env.example: placeholder values for documentation
